# Bynocturne E-Commerce

## About the Project

This project is an e-commerce web application built as part of my React Masterclass journey. The goal is to create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly online store using React and related technologies.

## What I Have Done

- Set up the project structure using Create React App.
- Implemented basic routing with React Router.
- Designed and developed the homepage, product listing, and product detail pages.
- Integrated a mock API for product data.
- Added a shopping cart feature with add/remove functionality.
- Styled components using CSS modules for modularity and maintainability.

## Future Plans

- Integrate a real backend for product and order management.
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Add payment gateway integration for secure checkout.
- Improve UI/UX with advanced animations and responsive design.
- Write unit and integration tests for better reliability.
- Deploy the application for public access.
